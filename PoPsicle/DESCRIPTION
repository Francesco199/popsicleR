Title: Pipeline of Preprocessing for Single Cell Experiment
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jimmy Caroli, Francesco Grandi
Description: Here we present PoPsicle, a flexible R package aimed at providing most of the necessary quality controls and preliminary information for complete and detailed analysis of single cell RNA-seq data. In its workflow, PoPsicle integrates all the pivotal steps necessary to assess sample quality, apply data tailored filters and perform doublets calculation and annotation analysis. PoPsicle builds on the R package Seurat (v3.5) to perform most of its task, and integrates an R implementation of the Scrublet python module for the analysis of doublets presence. Furthermore, PoPsicle grants the possibility to investigate and analyze both human and mouse data, using organism specific integrated annotation packages. We believe that the flexible and detailed analysis pipeline of PoPsicle will provide help in both single cell data preprocessing and analysis.
